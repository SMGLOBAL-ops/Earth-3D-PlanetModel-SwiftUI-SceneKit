## Overview

The **Planet Rotation Simulation** is a 3D visualization project designed as a fundamental exploration of celestial mechanics and SceneKit. It offers an immersive representation of the dynamic interaction between two celestial bodies: a smaller planet (moon) orbiting a larger planet (Venus). Notably, it accurately simulates the moon's rotation on its own axis as it orbits the primary planet, providing a captivating and educational exploration of celestial phenomena.

**Note:** This project serves as a basic simulation for studying SceneKit and lays the foundation for an upcoming expansion into a full-fledged **Solar System Model**.

## Key Features

- **Realistic Celestial Dynamics**: Witness a faithful and visually striking portrayal of celestial bodies in motion. Observe the intricate dance of a moon as it gracefully orbits a larger planet, all while respecting the laws of physics.

- **Educational Value**: This simulation serves as an engaging educational tool, making it an excellent starting point for those interested in SceneKit and celestial mechanics. It enables users to intuitively grasp essential concepts, including orbital motion and axial rotation. It's ideal for students, educators, and anyone with an interest in astronomy.

- **User Interaction**: The interactive nature of the simulation allows users to explore and manipulate the 3D scene easily. You can use your mouse or touch gestures to rotate the view and observe the celestial bodies from various angles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you dive into the simulation, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- **Xcode**: The project is developed using SwiftUI and SceneKit, which are commonly used in iOS/macOS app development. Make sure you have Xcode installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/planet-rotation-simulation.git

## Usage

- **Open the project in Xcode.**
- **Build and run the project on an iOS/macOS simulator or physical device.**

### Upon launching the simulation, you'll be immersed in a captivating 3D representation of celestial motion. Here's how you can interact with it:

- **Interactive Exploration:** Utilize your mouse or touch gestures to rotate the view, enabling you to observe the celestial bodies from different perspectives.

- **Orbital Realism:** Pay close attention to the smaller planet (moon) as it elegantly orbits the larger planet (Venus). The orbits are meticulously simulated, showcasing the precision of celestial mechanics.

- **SceneKit Study:** This project provides an excellent opportunity for studying SceneKit, Apple's 3D graphics framework. Explore the code and gain insights into how to create 3D simulations and visualizations.
